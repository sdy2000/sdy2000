# Welcome to sdy2000's Profile!
"üë®‚Äçüíªüî•Programming is my passion, and every challenge and difficulty excites me."

 Hi I'm Sajad, I am a Software Developer who approaches every project with a commitment to efficiency and excellence. With expertise in a variety of programming fields, I create codes that are optimized for performance, easy to develop, and fully compatible with all components.

üìàüíØAs a developer, consultant, and responsive maintenance technician, I always test my code against all conditions and exceptions to ensure the best output. I prioritize code quality and performance improvement to deliver a remarkable product.

## Skills

Here are some of the key technologies I work with:

- **C#**, **.NET**, and **.NET Core**: These are the backbone of most of my projects. I enjoy working with the C# language and the .NET ecosystem.

- **ASP.NET MVC** and **ASP.NET Web API**: I have extensive experience in building web applications and RESTful APIs using these technologies.

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** (along with **SCSS**): I take pride in crafting clean and responsive front-end code to create visually appealing websites.

- **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**: I'm proficient in both vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript. I enjoy working with modern web frameworks like **React.JS** and **Next.JS**.

- **Redux.JS**: I have used Redux for state management in various projects, ensuring a scalable and maintainable application architecture.

- **TailwindCss** and **Bootstrap**: These are my go-to CSS frameworks for quickly styling and prototyping web applications.

- **SQL** and **Microsoft SQL Server**: I'm well-versed in working with databases and writing efficient SQL queries.
